Up to 4 players may participate to build their economic empires. The entire board consists of 45 squares laid out in a 9x5 pattern. In the center is a Community Bazaar where harvested goods may be bought and/or sold.
<br><br>
Starting off, harvesting is done by:<br>
Mining (build a Mining facility)<br>
Farming/Fishing (build a Farm facility)<br>
Collecting energy (build Wind or Solar facilities)<br>
<br><br>
These are the basic facilities that players start with.<br>

<b>1/18/2011</b>: Currently, the source is very rough as I have just now uploaded. Sebastian and I will be updating fairly regularly to clean up dead classes or methods. I will also be documenting heavily once a viewport issue is resolved.<br>
<b>1/20/2011</b>: Viewport issues cleared up - mouse tracking perfectly and grid cells are located correctly (all of them). Posted a wiki on areas to be worked on.<br>
<b>1/22/2011</b>: Found <a href='http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx'>http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx</a> - this will most likely have a huge impact on how we develop the GameLib.DataManager.<br>
Also, welcome <code>sonofwau</code>. He will be working with numerical algorithms and mechanical balance. We might be able to talk him into working on the random number generator. :)<br>
The CsvReader is a success at this point. We can load data from .csv file and into a DataTable object.<br>
<b>1/28/2011</b>: Lots of progress in showing images. MouseOver events firing on all cylinders and showing player Area highlights.
