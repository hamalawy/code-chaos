This is a VB Macro sample from: http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/132566  

This macro read a Calc spreadsheet and copies the data into an OpenOffice Base table:  

{{{
Dim RowSetObj As Object, ConnectToDatabase As Object

DBContext=createUnoService("com.sun.star.sdb.DatabaseContext")
DataSource=DBContext.getByName("TasksDB")
ConnectToDatabase=DataSource.GetConnection ("","")

oURL="private:factory/scalc"
oDoc=StarDesktop.loadComponentFromURL(oURL, "_blank", 0, Array())
oSheet=oDoc.Sheets(0)
oSheet.Name="Tasks"

SQLQuery= "SELECT ""Task"", ""Date"", ""Done"" FROM ""tasks"" ORDER BY ""Date"" ASC"
SQLStatement=ConnectToDatabase.createStatement
RowSetObj=SQLStatement.executeQuery (SQLQuery)
}}}

The project will be to make a conversion of this in C# so we can read OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets for our data as we begin testing data algorithms.  

If someone actually finds a sample of C# that does what I'm trying to do, leave a comment or leave a message for us in our IRC web chat.
