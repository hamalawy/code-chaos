DataLoading is performed through a library authored by Sebastien Lorien. The source, demo, and article can be found at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx?msg=3744574#xx3744574xx .  

This is going to be for early stage development of numerical algorithms and determining mechanical balance, numerical limits, and random range generation.  

CsvReader appears to be a very useful and lightweight solution to reading .csv file data.
