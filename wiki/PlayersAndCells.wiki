Players are represented in code by the Player class (Player.cs).

For development, it would be ideal to display a colored border outlining player areas: red, blue, green, yellow.

Player class contains getters/setters for:
  * public string Name
  * public float Credits
  * public float Worth  

Player also maintains:
  * collection of it's Cells

The Cell class (Cell.cs) will be the container class with getters/setters for any cell properties. I will update this information as it is developed.
